## **Testing**

The W3C Markup Validator and the W3C CSS Validator were used to validate the html and css files in the project and to ensure there were no syntax errors and JS Hint was used to check the javascript file.

* **W3C Markup Validator**
index.html -  

* **W3C CSS Validator**
style.css - 

* **JS Hint** 
quiz.js - 

## **Testing User Stories**

The manual testing was carried out based on the User Stories to demonstrate key functions and features are fulfilled.

**CRUD functionality**

Users can upload their recipes via the recipe form (see below) on the "Add a recipe" for other users and visitors to view, fulfilling the "create" aspect of CRUD. 

![Recipe form](/static/img/recipe_form.png)

Users can read recipes on the "Recipes" page (see below) starting with the most recent recipe, fulfilling the "read" aspect of CRUD.

![Recipes](/static/img/recipes.png)

Users can update or delete their own recipes on the "My recipes" page by clicking on the edit or delete buttons in the detailed recipe view, fulfilling the "read" and "delete" aspects of CRUD. 

![Recipe details](/static/img/edit_delete_buttons.png)

After clicking the edit button the user is navigated back to the recipe form view (see below) where ingredients and instructions can be amended or removed. 

![Edit recipe](/static/img/edit_recipe.png)

The user's own recipes can be deleted in the  detailed recipe view by clicking the delete button then confirming by clicking it again. 

![Confirm delete](/static/img/delete_confirmation.png)

**Registration and Log in**

Users expect to be able to register to the website in order to share their own recipes, and access these at any time by logging in. Under the "Login/Register" button in the navbar a registration and log in form was implemented to fulfill this function (see below).

![Register/Login](/static/img/reg_login.png)

**Share functionality**

Users expect to be able to share recipes through social media, therefore a Facebook share button was implemented navigating the user to the correct share link in a new window.

**Social media links**

Relevant social media links are available in the footer, these are opening in separate windows.
  
**Design elements**

Users expect to be able to access information easily therefore a clear and easy to read design was implemented with added aria-labels for accessibility. The website design is fully responsive across all devices, this feature was tested on desktop, tablet and mobile. 

**Manual testing of functions**

Manual testing was used to make sure all buttons and functions are fully functional. Cross-browser testing was carried out to ensure the website's functions work as desired across all applications. Browsers used for testing: Safari, Google Chrome, Firefox. Devices used for testing: mobile, tablet and desktop.

## **Security**

This project involves secret keys for the successful melding of GitHub, Heroku and MongoDB with the development environment. This was achieved via a local env.py that is listed in the .gitignore file and can be found in the repository as well as the password and database name.

All users are required to provide a password when they register which are hashed by using "generate_password_hash" from the werkzeug.security library. Hashed passwords are then checked against each other upon log in.

Admins have the ability to access, edit or remove any recipes. The Cupcake Club admins reserve the right to modify any recipes that are deemed inappropriate, irrelevant or offensive.

## **Deployment**

### Local Deployment

I have created The Cupcake Club using Github and VS Code. 
With every change in the codebase I've made a commit with a detailed description attached, followed by a "git push" to update my GitHub repository.
I've deployed this project to Heroku and used the "git push heroku main" command to make sure my pushes to GitHub were also made to Heroku. 

For local deployment see the following steps:

1. From the application's repository, click the "code" button and download the zip of the repository. Alternatively, you can clone the repository using the following line in your terminal:

    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/DoriCzele/CupcakeClub.git
    ``` 

2. Access the folder in your terminal window and install the application's [required modules](https://github.com/DoriCzele/CupcakeClub/blob/main/requirements.txt) using the following command:

    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Sign-in to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and create a new cluster:
    * Click on Collections button then click on Create Database (Add My Own Data) called cupcakeClub (ensure same as DB_NAME environment variable)
    * Set up the following collections: users and recipes according to the database structure
    * Under the Security Menu on the left, select Database Access.
    * Add a new database user and keep the credentials secure
    * Within the Network Access option add IP Address 0.0.0.0

4. In your IDE, create a file containing your environmental variables called env.py at the root level of the application. 
    It should contain the following lines and variables:

    ```
    import os

    os.environ["HOST"] = "0.0.0.0"
    os.environ["PORT"] = "8000"
    os.environ["DEBUG"] = "True"
    os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>"
    os.environ["MONGO_URI"] = "<YOUR_MONGODB_URI>"
    os.environ["MONGO_DB"]= "<DATABASE_NAME>"
    ```

    Update the **SECRET_KEY** with your own secret key, as well as the **MONGO_URI** and **MONGO_DB** variables with those provided by MongoDB.
    To find your MONGO_URI, go to your clusters and click on connect. 
    Choose connect your application and copy the link provided. 
    Update the necessary fields like password and database name. 

    In case you're pushing this application to a public repository, ensure that env.py is added to your .gitignore file.

5. To run the application locally type the following command to the terminal: 
    ```
    python3 app.py. 
    ```
    
### Heroku Deployment 

1. Log in to Heroku account and create a new app (make sure you chose the correct region). 

2. Ensure the Procfile and requirements.txt files are present and up-to-date in the local repository.  

    Requirements:
    ```
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```
    Procfile:
    ```
    echo web: python app.py > Procfile
    ```
3. The Procfile should contain the following line:
    ```
    web: python app.py
    ```

4. Scroll down to "deployment method"-section and pick "Github" for automatic deployment.
5. Select your github user, enter the name for your repository and click on connect.
6. Click on "settings" then click on "Reveal config vars". Set up the same variables as in your env.py (HOST, PORT, DEBUG, SECRET_KEY, MONGO_URI and MONGO_DB):
    MAke sure you don't set the DEBUG variable in under config vars, to avoid DEBUG being active on the live website. 

    ```
    IP = 0.0.0.0
    PORT = 8000
    SECRET_KEY = <YOUR_SECRET_KEY>
    MONGO_URI = <YOUR_MONGODB_URI>
    MONGO_DBNAME = <DATABASE_NAME>
    ```

7. Click "Deploy" then click "Enable automatic deployment".
8. Click "Deploy branch" and Heroku starts building the app. Once the build is complete to open it click "view app".
